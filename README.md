# Celestial Bodies Database

## This is one of the required projects to earn my [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database) Relational Database Certification. For this project, I had to build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.


**Complete the tasks below**

:heavy_check_mark: You should create a database named universe

:heavy_check_mark: Be sure to connect to your database with \c universe. Then, you should add tables named galaxy, star, planet, and moon

:heavy_check_mark: Each table should have a primary key

:heavy_check_mark: Each primary key should automatically increment

:heavy_check_mark: Each table should have a name column

:heavy_check_mark: You should use the INT data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key

:heavy_check_mark: You should use the NUMERIC data type at least once

:heavy_check_mark: You should use the TEXT data type at least once

:heavy_check_mark: You should use the BOOLEAN data type on at least two columns

:heavy_check_mark: Each "star" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in galaxy

:heavy_check_mark: Each "planet" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in star

:heavy_check_mark: Each "moon" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in planet

:heavy_check_mark: Your database should have at least five tables

:heavy_check_mark: Each table should have at least three rows

:heavy_check_mark: The galaxy and star tables should each have at least six rows

:heavy_check_mark: The planet table should have at least 12 rows

:heavy_check_mark: The moon table should have at least 20 rows

:heavy_check_mark: Each table should have at least three columns

:heavy_check_mark: The galaxy, star, planet, and moon tables should each have at least five columns

:heavy_check_mark: At least two columns per table should not accept NULL values

:heavy_check_mark: At least one column from each table should be required to be UNIQUE

:heavy_check_mark: All columns named name should be of type VARCHAR

:heavy_check_mark: Each primary key column should follow the naming convention table_name_id. For example, the moon table should have a primary key column named moon_id

:heavy_check_mark: Each foreign key column should have the same name as the column it is referencing
